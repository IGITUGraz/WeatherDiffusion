# Restoring Vision in Adverse Weather Conditions with Patch-Based Denoising Diffusion Models

This is the code repository of the following [paper](https://....pdf) to train and perform inference with patch-based diffusion models for image restoration under adverse weather conditions.

"Restoring Vision in Adverse Weather Conditions with Patch-Based Denoising Diffusion Models"\
<em>Ozan Ã–zdenizci, Robert Legenstein</em>\
arXiv preprint, 2022.

Currently the repository is being prepared. Code and model checkpoints are going to be included soon.

In the meantime, check out below for some visualizations of our patch-based diffusive image restoration approach.

## Datasets

We perform experiments for image desnowing on [Snow100K](https://sites.google.com/view/yunfuliu/desnownet), combined image deraining and dehazing on [Outdoor-Rain](https://github.com/liruoteng/HeavyRainRemoval), and raindrop removal on
the [RainDrop](https://github.com/rui1996/DeRaindrop) datasets. To train multi-weather restoration, we used the AllWeather training set from [TransWeather](https://github.com/jeya-maria-jose/TransWeather), which is composed of subsets of training images from these three benchmarks.
